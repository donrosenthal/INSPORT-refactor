NEW JERSEY — IMPORTANT NOTICE CONCERNING THE
EXCLUSION OF DAMAGE CAUSED BY FLOOD

All homeowners are cautioned that:

1.

Homeowner and other personal property insurance policies do not cover property damage from
floods.

Flood means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry
land area from:

i. | The overflow of inland or tidal waters;
ii. | The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface water from any source;

iii. Mudslides (that is, mudflows) that are proximately caused by flooding and are akin to a river of
liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, including your premises, as
when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the current;

Flood also includes the collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of
water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding cyclical
levels, which results in the partial or complete inundation of normally dry land area;

Standard homeowners insurance policies do not coverage damage to property, contents and
structure resulting from floods; however, flood insurance may be available through the National
Flood Insurance Program which exists in participating communities.

The National Flood Insurance Program coverage contains separate content and structure coverages
and the policyholder should consult the National Flood Insurance Program. If you have any
questions, please contact your Safeco agent or broker listed on the Policy Declarations included
within your policy package.

The above summary is for information purposes only and does not provide coverage. Your Policy
Declarations in conjunction with your Policy, Special Provisions and other coverage forms
provide complete details of your coverage. If the above summary conflicts with the applicable
policy language, the policy language prevails.
