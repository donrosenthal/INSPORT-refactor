NEW JERSEY EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE AVAILABILITY NOTICE

All insureds and applicants are cautioned that homeowners insurance policies do not provide coverage
for earthquake damage.

The definition of an earthquake:

* is a shaking or trembling of the earth that is geologic or tectonic in nature;
* includes shock waves or tremors before, during or after a volcanic eruption; and

* can also include after-shocks that occur within a seventy-two hour period following an
earthquake.

A typical homeowners insurance policy:

¢ does not cover the cost to replace or repair your damaged dwelling, premises or structures,
such as garages, resulting from an earthquake;

« does not cover the cost to replace or repair the contents of your home if the damages result
from an earthquake; and

* does not pay for any additional living expenses if your property is badly damaged or destroyed
by an earthquake.

Earthquake insurance is available through an endorsement to your policy for an additional
premium. The decision to purchase earthquake insurance is one that should be carefully
considered based on individual circumstances.

Historically, an earthquake in New Jersey is a rare event, although the possibility exists that it could
happen. Over the five-year period from 2010 to 2015, for every $1 of earthquake insurance premium,
1/10 of one cent has been paid out for losses.

Please contact your Safeco agent or broker if you have any questions or want additional
information on how you can obtain earthquake insurance.

This notice is a general description of coverage and does not change, modify or invalidate any of
the provisions, terms or conditions of your policy or endorsements.
