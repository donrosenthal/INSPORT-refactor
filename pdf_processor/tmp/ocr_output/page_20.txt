Number of open accounts reported as ‘paid as agreed’

What information is this message derived from? The score considers the number of open accounts on the
consumer's credit file that have been paid as agreed.

How does this affect my insurance risk score? Research shows that consumers with multiple active
accounts that are paid as agreed have fewer insurance losses.

What can | do to improve this aspect of my score? If you only have a few accounts, keeping them active
and making payments on time shows that you manage your credit obligations responsibly.
