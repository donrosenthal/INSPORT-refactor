*â€œ* REPRINTED FROM THE ARCHIVE. THE ORIGINAL TRANSACTION MAY INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FORMS ****

If all three of the requirements listed above have been met, then we will provide the following to the insured:
1. Case Management Service
Services of an ID recovery case manager as needed to respond to the ID theft.
2. Expense Reimbursement

Reimbursement of necessary and reasonable /D theft expenses incurred as a direct result of the
ID theft.

This coverage is additional insurance.
LIMITS

Case Management Service is available as needed for any one ID theft for up to 12 months in a row from the
inception of the service. Expenses we incur to provide Case Management Service do not reduce the amount
of limit available for Expense Reimbursement coverage.

Expense Reimbursement coverage is subject to a limit of $25,000 annual aggregate per insured. This limit
is the most we will pay for the total of all loss or expense arising out of all ID thefts to any one insured which
are first discovered by the insured during the present annual policy period. This limit applies regardless of
the number of claims during that period.

An ID theft may be first discovered by the insured in one policy period and continue into other policy periods.
If so, all loss and expense arising from such ID theft will be subject to the aggregate limit applicable to the
policy period when the ID theft was first discovered by the insured.

Coverage for legal costs is found under item d. of the definition of ID theft expenses. Such legal costs are
part of, and not in addition to, the Expense Reimbursement coverage limit.

Item e. Lost Wages and item f. Child and Elder Care Expenses of the definition of ID theft expenses are
jointly subject to a sub-limit of $250 per day, not to exceed $5,000 in total. This sub-limit is part of, and not
in addition to, the Expense Reimbursement coverage limit. Coverage is limited to wages lost and expenses
incurred within 12 months after the first discovery of the JD theft by the insured.

DEDUCTIBLE
Case Management Service is not subject to a deductible.

Expense Reimbursement coverage is subject to a deductible as shown on your Declarations page. You shall
be responsible for only one deductible under this endorsement during any one policy period.

EXCLUSIONS

The following additional exclusions apply to this coverage. These exclusions apply to both Case Management
Service and Expense Reimbursement.

We do not cover loss or expense arising from any of the following.
1. The theft of a professional or business identity.

2. Any fraudulent, dishonest or criminal act by an insured. This includes any such act by a person
aiding or abetting an insured. This also includes any such act by an authorized representative of
an insured. |n all these cases, it does not matter whether the individual is acting alone or in
collusion with others.

3. Loss other than ID theft expenses. Account balances which arise out of fraudulent charges would
be one example of loss other than /D theft expenses.

4. An ID theft first discovered by the insured prior to or after the period for which this coverage
applies. This exclusion applies whether or not such /D theft began or continued during the period
of coverage.

5. An /D theft that is not reported to us within 60 days after it is first discovered by the insured.
An ID theft that is not reported in writing to the police.
