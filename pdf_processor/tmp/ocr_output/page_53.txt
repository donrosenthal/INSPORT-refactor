*“* REPRINTED FROM THE ARCHIVE. THE ORIGINAL TRANSACTION MAY INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FORMS ****

We may void this policy or deny coverage because of fraud or material misrepresentation even after a loss or
occurrence. This means we will not be liable for any claims or damages which would otherwise be covered.
If we make a payment, we may request that you reimburse us. If so, you must reimburse us for any
payments we may have already made.

3. Liberalization Clause. If we make a change which broadens coverage under this edition of our policy
without additional premium charge, that change will automatically apply to your insurance as of the date we
implement the change in your state.

This liberalization clause does not apply to changes implemented that involve a broadening and a restriction
of coverage or an increase in premium.

4. Cancellation.

a. You may cancel this policy at any time by returning it to us or by notifying us in writing of the date
cancellation is to take effect. We may waive the requirement the notice be in writing by confirming the
date and time of cancellation to you in writing.

b. We may cancel this policy only for the reasons stated below by notifying you in writing of the date
cancellation takes effect. This cancellation notice may be delivered to you, or mailed to you at your
mailing address shown in your Policy Declarations. Proof of mailing shall be sufficient proof of notice.

(1) When you have not paid the premium we may cancel at any time by notifying you at least 10 days
before the date cancellation takes effect.

(2) When this policy has been in effect for less than 60 days and is not a renewal with us, we may
cancel for any reason by notifying you at least 10 days before the date cancellation takes effect.

(3) When this policy has been in effect for 60 days or more, or at any time if it is a renewal with us, we
may cancel if there has been a material misrepresentation of fact which if known to us would have
caused us not to issue the policy or if the risk has changed substantially since the policy was
issued.

This can be done by notifying you at least 15 days before the date cancellation takes effect.

c. When this policy is canceled, the premium for the period from the date of cancellation to the expiration
date will be refunded. If the return premium is not refunded with the notice of cancellation or when this
policy is returned to us for cancellation, we will refund it within a reasonable time after the date
cancellation takes effect.

5. Non-Renewal. We may elect not to renew this policy. We may do so by delivering to you, or mailing to you
at your mailing address shown in your Policy Declarations, written notice at least 20 days before the
expiration date of this policy. Proof of mailing shall be sufficient proof of notice.

6. Assignment. Assignment of this policy shall not be valid unless and until we give our written consent.

7. Our Right to Recover Payment. You may waive in writing before a loss all rights of recovery against any
person. If not waived, we may require an assignment of rights of recovery for a loss. If not waived, we may
require an assignment of rights of recovery for a loss to the extent that payment is made by us.

If an assignment is sought, the insured shall sign and deliver all related papers and cooperate with us in any
reasonable manner.

Subrogation does not apply under Section II to Coverage F — Medical Payments to Others or Additional

benefits specific to that program. The benefits enhance the safety, value, usability, life, or protection of you
or your insurable assets. These benefits include, but are not limited to, reduced deductibles, devices,
