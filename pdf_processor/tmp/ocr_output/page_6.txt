Let’s make sure you’re “fully insured.”

Your agent uses replacement cost estimation tools to establish a starting point for your insurance
coverage. But you know your home best. And we look to you to give your agent the most complete, up-to-
date information in order to protect your home and lifestyle. Here are two quick things you can do today:

1. Look critically at your coverage statement page (also known as the policy declarations page,
which comes after the opening letter in this package). Do you believe you have enough
Coverage A? (This is the amount you’d get for reconstruction of an as-close-as-possible replica of
your home in the event of total loss.) If you’re not sure, call your agent for help.

2. Take inventory. Compare the value of your personal belongings to the Coverage C amount on your
coverage statement page.

It’s important to know: your home’s market value is totally different from what it would cost to
reconstruct. Today's market value reflects economic conditions, taxes, school districts, the market value
of land and many other factors that have nothing to do with how much it would cost to reconstruct your
home from scratch.

Reconstruction cost — the amount needed to get you back home quickly — is based almost exclusively
on the cost of materials and labor as well as demand for contractor services. In the event of total loss, a
properly insured Safeco policyholder can rebuild with the same quality of materials and workmanship in
their current home (unless a functional replacement cost policy was deliberately selected). Of course, we
hope you’ Il never need these services. But we’ Il all sleep better knowing you’ re fully insured.

Thank you for trusting Safeco with your home insurance needs.
