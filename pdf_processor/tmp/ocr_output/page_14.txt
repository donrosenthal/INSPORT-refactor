I have an excellent credit rating; does this mean | qualify for the best insurance premium?

That depends. Since insurance scores measure items related to insurance losses and credit scores
measure creditworthiness, these scores may be very different. Items on a credit report considered by an
insurance company may not be ones considered by a lender. Likewise, there may be items on a credit
report used by a lender that are not relevant to an insurer. Additionally, insurance companies consider a
number of other factors when determining your automobile premium such as driving record, prior loss
history, and vehicle type. For your homeowner premium, insurers may consider prior loss history,
construction type, distance to fire stations and fire hydrants, and presence of protective devices such as
smoke detectors, theft alarms, and deadbolt locks. State laws and regulations also vary, so the factors
insurers may use to calculate premium or determine eligibility may differ by state.

Can an exception be made for customers who have experienced a medical hardship?

Yes, with the proper documentation, Safeco will take into consideration those customers that have gone
through a medical hardship and possess catastrophic medical expenses. Safeco may consider
exceptions for other extraordinary circumstances. Availability of these exceptions may vary due to
differences in state laws and regulations.

Does the use of credit by Safeco affect my credit rating?

record of the inquiry by Safeco will be on the copy obtained by the consumer, if he or she chooses to

What happens if Safeco makes an adverse decision based on my credit information?

Under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act an applicant is entitled to receive a free copy of their credit
report whenever an insurer or creditor has taken an adverse action’.

If Safeco takes an adverse decision based on your credit information, we will provide you with a separate
written notice advising you of the primary reasons for our action, the name, address and telephone
number of the consumer reporting agency that provided the information, and of your rights to receive a
free copy of your credit report.

If you notice an error on your credit report, you can dispute this information and ask the consumer
reporting agency to correct it. While an individual error is not likely to have a large impact on an insurance
score, if the error does impact your policy premium, Safeco will be glad to reevaluate the policy and
adjust the premium based on the corrected information.

*Your right to receive a free report due to an adverse action is in addition to the free credit report that you
are annually entitled to request from each nationwide credit bureau under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
