(2) adverse impact on the acquisition of financing resulting from the covered physical damage to the
property.
Loss to a Pair or Set. In case of loss to a pair or set we may elect to:
a. repair or replace any part to restore the pair or set to its value before the loss; or
b. pay the difference between actual cash value of the pair or set before and after the loss.

Appraisal. If you and we do not agree on the amount of the loss, including the amount of actual cash value
or replacement cost, then, on the written demand of either, each shall select a competent and disinterested
appraiser and notify the other of the appraiser selected within 20 days of such demand. The appraisers shall
first select a competent and disinterested umpire; and failing for 15 days to agree upon such umpire, then, on
request of you or the company, and after notice of hearing to the non-requesting party by certified mail, such
umpire shall be selected by a judge of a court of record in the county in which the property covered is
located. The appraisers shall then appraise the loss, stating separately the itemized estimate of the actual
cash value and replacement cost of each item and duration of repairs, if requested, and failing to agree,
each shall submit their differences, only, to the umpire. An award in writing, so itemized, of any two of these
three, when filed with the company shall determine the amount of loss.

Each party will:
a. pay its own appraiser; and
b. bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally.

In no event will an appraisal be used for the purpose of interpreting any policy provision, determining
causation, or determining whether any item or loss is covered under this policy. If there is an appraisal, we
still retain the right to deny the claim.

Suit Against Us. No action shall be brought against us unless there has been compliance with the policy
provisions and the action is started within one year after the inception of the loss or damage.

Our Option. If we give you written notice within 30 days after we receive your signed, sworn proof of loss,
we may repair or replace any part of the property damaged with equivalent property.

Loss Payment. We will adjust all losses with you. We will pay you unless some other person is named in the
policy to receive payment. Loss will be payable 30 days after:

a. wereach agreement with you;

b. there is an entry of a final judgment; or

c. there is a filing of an appraisal award with us.

Abandonment of Property. We need not accept any property abandoned by any insured.
Mortgage Clause.

The word "mortgagee" includes trustee. If a mortgagee is named in this policy, any loss payable under
Coverage A — Condominium Building Items shall be paid to the mortgagee and you, as interests appear.
If more than one mortgagee is named, the order of payment shall be the same as the order of precedence of
the mortgages.

If we deny your claim, that denial shall not apply to a valid claim of the mortgagee, if the mortgagee:

a. notifies us of any change in ownership, occupancy, or substantial change in risk of which the mortgagee
is aware;

b. pays any premium due under this policy on demand if you have neglected to pay the premium;

c. submits a signed, sworn statement of loss within 60 days after receiving notice from us of your failure to
do so; and

d. complies with item 3.e. of Section | — Property Conditions.

Policy conditions relating to Appraisal, Suit Against Us, and Loss Payment apply to the mortgagee. If the
policy is canceled or not renewed by us, the mortgagee shall receive the same number of days’ notice as the
insured under the Cancellation and Non-Renewal provisions of this policy.
