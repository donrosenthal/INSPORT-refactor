Number of inquiries reported

What information is this message derived from? The score considers inquiries initiated by you when you
are actively seeking to obtain credit, or to obtain higher limits on an existing account. It does not consider
inquiries initiated by you to obtain your own insurance score or inquiries related to obtaining an insurance
policy. Promotional inquiries (such as an offer of an unsolicited credit card), account reviews by an
existing creditor, collection inquiries or other queries not solicited by you are not included in this score.
Inquiries as a result of searching for rates on a similar type of loan, such as auto and/or mortgage loans
are counted as one inquiry if they occur within 30 days.

How does this affect my insurance score? Research shows a correlation between applying for more credit
accounts, or extending your credit, with more insurance losses.

What can | do to improve this aspect of my score? Inquiries initiated by you will remain on your credit
report for two (2) years. A common misperception is that every inquiry drops your score a certain number
of points. In reality, the impact each inquiry has on your score varies depending on your overall credit
profile. To improve this aspect of your score, apply for credit only when needed.
