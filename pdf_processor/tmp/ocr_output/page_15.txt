Insurance Information and the Use of Credit

Thank you for being a Safeco Insurance customer. We appreciate your business and the trust you have
placed with us.

Like most insurance companies, we use credit information as a factor in determining the cost of your
insurance. We do so because research studies have shown it to be an accurate predictor of the proba-
bility of future insurance losses. Studies also show that a majority of customers benefit from the use of
credit information.

I's important to understand that many factors are used to determine the cost of insurance such as
driving history for auto insurance, the year your home was built for home insurance, previous insurance
and claims history, discounts and coverage limits. Your credit history is also part of the overall calcu-
lation that determines your premium. We look at credit history very differently than a financial institution
because we’re not evaluating your credit-worthiness. We’re using credit-based information in combina-
tion with other factors to help us properly price insurance risks.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

Why do you use my credit information?

Insurance companies often use credit information because it is a predictor of the probability of future
losses. Its use is an objective way to assess and price potential risk and enables us to more accurately
price policies and equitably distribute insurance costs among our policyholders.

Is my credit history the only factor that determines my rate?

No. Many factors such as previous insurance, claims history, discounts and coverage limits go into de-
termining what you pay for your insurance. In addition, the information you provided when you pur-
chased your policy and the verification of that information is used to determine your rate.

How do | know if I’m getting the best possible rate?

One of the benefits of buying insurance through an independent agent is their ability to advise you on
your options and ways to save money. Between the guidance of your local independent agent and a vast
array of Safeco options, you can be sure you’re getting the coverage you want at a competitive rate. If
you have any questions, we encourage you to contact your independent Safeco agent and ask for an
insurance checkup.

How is credit information used in determining my rate?

Safeco, like most insurance companies, calculates an insurance score based on information from your
credit report. Different values or weights are assigned to the information contained in your credit report,
such as payment history, amounts owed or the number of applications for new credit lines. The total sum
of these weights creates your insurance score. As a result, it is likely that some of your credit information
helped to improve your insurance score, and some lowered it. The calculation process and weights used
by each insurance company and/or its service providers are proprietary and confidential. As a result,
we do not disclose your specific score or the details of how it was calculated.

How did my credit information affect my rate?

Your rate was adversely affected because either we were unable to obtain an insurance score for you, or
because of your credit information. If it was due to your credit information, the reasons are explained

in this document under "What factors affected my insurance score?"

What can | do to improve my insurance score?

Safeco and independent insurance agents are not credit counselors or financial advisors, so we are not
in a position to provide specific advice on how to improve your credit or insurance score. However, we
can tell you that the areas that have the biggest impact on your credit report are: payment history,
amounts owed, length of credit history, new credit applications and type of credit accounts. To get a copy
of your current credit report, contact TransUnion and follow the instructions under “How do | get a copy
of my credit report?”
