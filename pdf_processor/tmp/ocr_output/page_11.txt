Most condominium policies in New Jersey include the following common coverages:

. Dwelling (Coverage A) Your condominium policy will cover property that is permanently installed in your
condo unit that is not otherwise covered by your condominium association’s insurance policy.

. Personal Property (Coverage C) pays if the items in your condo unit (such as furniture, clothing, and
appliances) are damaged, stolen, or destroyed by a covered loss.

: Loss of Use (Coverage D) pays your additional living expenses (costs over the normal amount for housing,
food, and other essential expenses) if you must temporarily move because damage to your condo unit from a
covered loss renders it uninhabitable.

° Personal Liability (Coverage E) pays to defend you in court against certain lawsuits and provides coverage
if you are found legally responsible for someone else’s injury or property damage.

. Medical Payments to Others (Coverage F) pays the medical bills of people hurt on your property. It might
also pay for some injuries that happen away from your condo unit, such as your dog biting someone at the
park.
