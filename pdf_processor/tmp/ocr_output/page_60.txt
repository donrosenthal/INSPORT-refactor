Non-Renewal. We may elect not to renew this policy for any reason permitted to cancel this policy. We may
do so by delivering to you, or mailing to you, written notice, stating the reasons for non-renewal, at least 31
days before the expiration date of this policy. Proof of mailing shall be sufficient proof of notice.

This non-renewal notice may be delivered to you, or mailed to you at your mailing address shown in your
Policy Declarations by certified mail, or first-class mail if we have obtained, from the U.S. Post Office, a date
stamped proof of mailing showing your name and address.

Under 7. Our Right To Recover Payment, the following is added:

If we pay any insured, who is a victim of domestic violence, for a loss caused by an act of domestic
violence, the rights of that insured to recover damages from the perpetrator of the domestic violence are
transferred to us to the extent of our payment. That insured may not waive such rights to recover against the
perpetrator of the domestic violence.

The following is added to existing SECTIONS I AND II — PROPERTY AND LIABILITY CONDITIONS:

1.

Additional Policy Protection. If one or more of our programs apply to you, you will be eligible to receive
benefits specific to that program. The benefits enhance the safety, value, usability, life, or protection of you or
your insurable assets. These benefits include, but are not limited to, reduced deductibles, devices,
equipment, services, or other benefits provided by either us or a business partner.

Insurance Department Requirement — Cancellation and Non-Renewal. Pursuant to New Jersey law, this
policy cannot be cancelled or non-renewed for any underwriting reason or guideline which is arbitrary,
capricious or unfairly discriminatory or without adequate prior notice to the insured.

The underwriting reasons or guidelines that an insurer can use to cancel or non-renew this policy are
maintained by the insurer in writing and will be furnished to the insured and/or the insured’s lawful
representative upon written request.

This provision shall not apply to any policy which has been in effect for less than 60 days at the time notice of
cancellation is mailed or delivered, unless the policy is a renewal policy.

Insurance Department Requirement — Standard Fire Insurance Policy. This policy provides coverage to
the insured on an equivalent or more favorable basis than that provided by the statutory provisions cited in
N.J.S.A. 17:36-5.20.

All other provisions of this policy apply.
