IMPORTANT PREMIUM SURCHARGE NOTICE

Companies writing Property and Casualty insurance business in New Jersey are required to participate in
the New Jersey Property-Liability Insurance Guaranty Association (“Association”). If a company becomes
insolvent, the Association settles unpaid claims and then assesses member insurers in amounts
necessary to pay those covered claims, the expenses of handling claims, and the costs of examinations
and other authorized expenses.

New Jersey permits us to recover those assessments by imposing a surcharge. If your policy is
surcharged, the phrase “NEW JERSEY PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE GUARANTEE
ASSOCIATION SURCHARGE?’ and the appropriate dollar amount will appear on your policy Declarations.
