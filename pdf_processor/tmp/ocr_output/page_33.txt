COVERAGE C — PERSONAL PROPERTY
PERSONAL PROPERTY WE COVER

1.

Personal property owned or used by any insured is covered while it is anywhere in the world. When
personal property is usually located at an insured’s residence, other than the residence premises,
coverage is limited to 10% of the Coverage C limit. Personal property in a newly acquired principal residence
is not subject to this limitation for the 30 days immediately after you begin to move the property there.

During the time the residence premises is under construction by or for the insured, our limit of liability for
personal property other than on the residence premises shall be equal to the amount specified for
Coverage C. Our total limit shall not exceed the policy limit for Coverage C in any one loss.

At your request we cover:

a. personal property owned by others while the property is on that part of the residence premises
occupied exclusively by any insured;

b. personal property owned by a guest or a residence employee, while the property is at any residence
occupied by any insured.

However, we will not cover personal property owned by tenants or guests if the tenants or guests have
compensated the insured for use of the residence premises.

SPECIAL LIMITS FOR PERSONAL PROPERTY

The following groups of personal property are covered only up to the special limit shown in on your Policy
Declarations. The special limit is the total amount available for each group for any one loss and does not
increase the Coverage C limit. The loss of, or damage to, more than one item in a group arising from the
same cause or event is considered one loss.
