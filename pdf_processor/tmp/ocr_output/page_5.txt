Ask yourself: Do you have
enough insurance coverage?

How much would it take to reconstruct your home?

Surprisingly, it has been estimated that 58% of American homes are underinsured by an average of
21%*. Make sure yours isn’t one of them.

How can you determine your needs? Ask yourself the questions below. If you need help
answering them, call your agent and discuss your insurance needs with them.
