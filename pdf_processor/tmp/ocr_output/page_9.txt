NOTICE OF INFORMATION PRACTICES

Safeco appreciates the trust you place in us when you purchase insurance from one of our companies.
We are committed to protecting your nonpublic personal information (“personal information” or
“information”) and we value you as a customer.

To learn more about how we collect and use information about you, please read the following notice.
OUR SOURCES OF INFORMATION ABOUT YOU

Most of the information we obtain comes directly from you and your independent insurance producer.
Your application gives us information we need to review your request, such as your name, address and
Social Security Number.

We may also ask for information from other outside sources, including:

¢ Your transactions with our affiliates or other insurance companies (such as your payment
history or claims history); and/or,

* The information we receive from a consumer reporting agency or insurance support
organization (such as your credit history, driving record, claims history or verification of the
value and condition of your property).

Insurance support organizations from which we obtain information may keep such information and
disclose it to others as permitted by law.

If we obtain medical information about you, it is generally received in connection with the administration or
management of your insurance policy or claim or for the detection and prevention of fraud. We will not
share your medical information with our affiliates or non-affiliates for marketing purposes.

It is our policy to treat information we receive about you in the same confidential way we treat information
that you have provided to us on your application. The same confidentiality applies to information about
our former customers.

OUR USE OF INFORMATION ABOUT YOU

We only disclose personal information about you as permitted by law. Generally, this includes sharing it
with third parties to administer your transactions with us, service your insurance policy or claim, detect
and prevent fraud, or with your authorization. We require these parties to use your personal data only for
the reasons we gave it to them. These third parties may include:

° Insurance support organizations, consumer reporting agencies or other insurance companies
(including for the detection and prevention of fraud);

. Independent insurance producers authorized to sell Safeco insurance products;

° Independent contractors (such as automobile repair facilities, towing companies, property
inspectors and independent claims representatives);

¢ Auditors, attorneys, courts and government agencies;

. Other companies which may reinsure your policy or with which you have other coverage;
. Group policyholders in connection with reporting claims data or an audit; and/or,

° Other companies and insurance support organizations for actuarial or research studies.

We may also disclose your personal information to other financial institutions with which we have joint
marketing agreements for products offered by Safeco and in response to judicial orders such as
subpoenas.

We may also share information about our transactions (such as payment history) and experiences (such
as claims made) with you within our Safeco family of companies.

We do not sell your personal information to others and we do not provide your information to third parties
who are doing business on our behalf for their own marketing purposes.
