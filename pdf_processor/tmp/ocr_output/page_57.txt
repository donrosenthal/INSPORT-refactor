is aware;

b. pays any premium due under this policy on demand if you have neglected to pay the premium;

c. submits a signed, sworn statement of loss within 60 days after receiving notice from us of your failure to
do so; and

cancellation or nonrenewal takes effect.

e. we are subrogated to all the rights of the mortgagee granted under the mortgage on the property; or

interest. In this event, we shall receive a full assignment and transfer of the mortgage and all securities
held as collateral to the mortgage debt.

Subrogation shall not impair the right of the mortgagee to recover the full amount of the mortgagee’s claim.
