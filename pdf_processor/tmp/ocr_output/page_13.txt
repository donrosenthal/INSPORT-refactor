Guide to the Use of Insurance Scores

Credit Information and Insurance

Most insurance companies use credit information. In fact, according to a study by Conning Research and
Consulting Inc., 92% of insurers use credit based insurance scores (Insurance Scoring in Personal
Automobile Insurance - Breaking the Silence, Conning & Co., 2001) . You may have questions about why
insurers use credit information and how do they use it. We are providing some frequently asked questions
and answers below, to help you to better understand how and why insurance companies, including
Safeco, use credit information.

(Safeco uses credit information where permissible by state law and regulation, and its use may vary
depending on the state’s laws and regulations)

What is an insurance score?

An insurance score is a number calculated by a statistical model using information contained in a credit
report. Insurance scores have been developed to help predict the likelihood of having an accident or filing
a claim.

What is the difference between an insurance score and a credit score and how are they
calculated?

While insurance scores predict insurance losses, credit scores predict credit delinquency. Both are
calculated from information in a credit report, such as outstanding debt, bankruptcies, length of credit
history, collections, new applications for credit, number of credit accounts in use and timeliness of debt
repayment. Insurers or scoring agencies then calculate the insurance or credit score by taking the
information in the credit report and assigning positive weights to the favorable information and negative
weights to the unfavorable information.

What kind of information is not used in insurance scoring models?

Information such as an applicant’s income, ethnic group, age, gender, disability, religion, address, marital
status, and nationality are not considered when calculating an insurance score.

Why does Safeco use the insurance score of an applicant?

Safeco, as well as many other insurance companies, uses insurance scores because they provide an
objective way to evaluate the risk of an applicant. Independent studies and Safeco experience show that
insurance scores are a very good predictor of future losses. When insurance scores are combined with
traditional risk evaluation factors (such as prior claims history, years of driving experience and driving
record) insurance companies can more accurately determine the risk an applicant presents. By using
insurance scores combined with other factors, policies can be more accurately priced. Individuals who are
more likely to have a claim will pay more for insurance and individuals who are less likely to have a claim
will pay less.

What type of credit information is generally associated with a favorable insurance score?
* Lengthy, established credit history Absence of collections
° No late payments
* Low credit balances relative to limits available
* Few recently opened credit accounts (new accounts opened only as needed)
How can I learn more about my credit information and how to manage it?

A good credit rating must be built over time. There are no "quick fixes". The Federal Trade Commission
website provides articles about managing personal credit history and scores.
