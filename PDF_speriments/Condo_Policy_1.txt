Ask yourself: Do you have
enough insurance coverage?

How much would it take to reconstruct your home?

Surprisingly, it has been estimated that 58% of American homes are underinsured by an average of
21%*. Make sure yours isn’t one of them.

Each home is unique. You know your home best. It's your responsibility to make sure you're “fully
insured” and “insured to value.” That means you need to have enough insurance coverage to rebuild your
home and replace all of your personal belongings in the event of total loss.

How can you determine your needs? Ask yourself the questions below. If you need help
answering them, call your agent and discuss your insurance needs with them.

They will assist you in determining how much insurance would be needed to fully protect your home and
belongings.

How much would it take to reconstruct your home at today’s prices?

Things to consider:

* Your home’s age (older homes tend to be more expensive to reconstruct) and style
(contemporary, colonial, ranch, etc.)

° Features — fireplaces, cabinetry, built-in features, vaulted ceilings

* Flooring — hardwood, tile, natural stone, carpeting

° Finishes — crown molding, window and floor trim, faux paint, wall paper, wainscoting, chair
rails, staircases, etc.

° Recent improvements you may have made (remodeled bathroom or kitchen, recessed lighting,
built-in cabinets)

* | Abasement you may have finished or a room you may have added

How much is enough to replace the structures surrounding your home at today’s prices?
Things to consider:
¢ Your fence, detached garage, gazebo, barn or storage shed
° If you have an in-ground swimming pool or just repaved your driveway or sidewalk

What would it take to replace your personal belongings at today’s prices?

Things to consider:

« All your basics (furniture, rugs, linens, kitchenware, tools) and every electronic gadget

* Your entire wardrobe, your jewelry, medicines and personal effects

° Have you made any big purchases lately?

° If you have a garage full of tools, are passionate about the latest gadgets or collect just about
anything, you should seriously consider getting more personal belongings coverage than the
standard policy provides.

Let’s make sure you’re “fully insured.”

Your agent uses replacement cost estimation tools to establish a starting point for your insurance
coverage. But you know your home best. And we look to you to give your agent the most complete, up-to-
date information in order to protect your home and lifestyle. Here are two quick things you can do today:

1. Look critically at your coverage statement page (also known as the policy declarations page,
which comes after the opening letter in this package). Do you believe you have enough
Coverage A? (This is the amount you’d get for reconstruction of an as-close-as-possible replica of
your home in the event of total loss.) If you’re not sure, call your agent for help.

2. Take inventory. Compare the value of your personal belongings to the Coverage C amount on your
coverage statement page.

It’s important to know: your home’s market value is totally different from what it would cost to
reconstruct. Today's market value reflects economic conditions, taxes, school districts, the market value
of land and many other factors that have nothing to do with how much it would cost to reconstruct your
home from scratch.

Reconstruction cost — the amount needed to get you back home quickly — is based almost exclusively
on the cost of materials and labor as well as demand for contractor services. In the event of total loss, a
properly insured Safeco policyholder can rebuild with the same quality of materials and workmanship in
their current home (unless a functional replacement cost policy was deliberately selected). Of course, we
hope you’ Il never need these services. But we’ Il all sleep better knowing you’ re fully insured.

Thank you for trusting Safeco with your home insurance needs.

IMPORTANT PREMIUM SURCHARGE NOTICE

Companies writing Property and Casualty insurance business in New Jersey are required to participate in
the New Jersey Property-Liability Insurance Guaranty Association (“Association”). If a company becomes
insolvent, the Association settles unpaid claims and then assesses member insurers in amounts
necessary to pay those covered claims, the expenses of handling claims, and the costs of examinations
and other authorized expenses.

New Jersey permits us to recover those assessments by imposing a surcharge. If your policy is
surcharged, the phrase “NEW JERSEY PROPERTY-LIABILITY INSURANCE GUARANTEE
ASSOCIATION SURCHARGE?’ and the appropriate dollar amount will appear on your policy Declarations.

NEW JERSEY — IMPORTANT NOTICE CONCERNING THE
EXCLUSION OF DAMAGE CAUSED BY FLOOD

All homeowners are cautioned that:

1.

Homeowner and other personal property insurance policies do not cover property damage from
floods.

Flood means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry
land area from:

i. | The overflow of inland or tidal waters;
ii. | The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface water from any source;

iii. Mudslides (that is, mudflows) that are proximately caused by flooding and are akin to a river of
liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, including your premises, as
when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the current;

Flood also includes the collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of
water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding cyclical
levels, which results in the partial or complete inundation of normally dry land area;

Standard homeowners insurance policies do not coverage damage to property, contents and
structure resulting from floods; however, flood insurance may be available through the National
Flood Insurance Program which exists in participating communities.

The National Flood Insurance Program coverage contains separate content and structure coverages
and the policyholder should consult the National Flood Insurance Program. If you have any
questions, please contact your Safeco agent or broker listed on the Policy Declarations included
within your policy package.

The above summary is for information purposes only and does not provide coverage. Your Policy
Declarations in conjunction with your Policy, Special Provisions and other coverage forms
provide complete details of your coverage. If the above summary conflicts with the applicable
policy language, the policy language prevails.

NEW JERSEY EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE AVAILABILITY NOTICE

All insureds and applicants are cautioned that homeowners insurance policies do not provide coverage
for earthquake damage.

The definition of an earthquake:

* is a shaking or trembling of the earth that is geologic or tectonic in nature;
* includes shock waves or tremors before, during or after a volcanic eruption; and

* can also include after-shocks that occur within a seventy-two hour period following an
earthquake.

A typical homeowners insurance policy:

¢ does not cover the cost to replace or repair your damaged dwelling, premises or structures,
such as garages, resulting from an earthquake;

« does not cover the cost to replace or repair the contents of your home if the damages result
from an earthquake; and

* does not pay for any additional living expenses if your property is badly damaged or destroyed
by an earthquake.

Earthquake insurance is available through an endorsement to your policy for an additional
premium. The decision to purchase earthquake insurance is one that should be carefully
considered based on individual circumstances.

Historically, an earthquake in New Jersey is a rare event, although the possibility exists that it could
happen. Over the five-year period from 2010 to 2015, for every $1 of earthquake insurance premium,
1/10 of one cent has been paid out for losses.

Please contact your Safeco agent or broker if you have any questions or want additional
information on how you can obtain earthquake insurance.

This notice is a general description of coverage and does not change, modify or invalidate any of
the provisions, terms or conditions of your policy or endorsements.

Guide to the Use of Insurance Scores

Credit Information and Insurance

Most insurance companies use credit information. In fact, according to a study by Conning Research and
Consulting Inc., 92% of insurers use credit based insurance scores (Insurance Scoring in Personal
Automobile Insurance - Breaking the Silence, Conning & Co., 2001) . You may have questions about why
insurers use credit information and how do they use it. We are providing some frequently asked questions
and answers below, to help you to better understand how and why insurance companies, including
Safeco, use credit information.

(Safeco uses credit information where permissible by state law and regulation, and its use may vary
depending on the state’s laws and regulations)

What is an insurance score?

An insurance score is a number calculated by a statistical model using information contained in a credit
report. Insurance scores have been developed to help predict the likelihood of having an accident or filing
a claim.

What is the difference between an insurance score and a credit score and how are they
calculated?

While insurance scores predict insurance losses, credit scores predict credit delinquency. Both are
calculated from information in a credit report, such as outstanding debt, bankruptcies, length of credit
history, collections, new applications for credit, number of credit accounts in use and timeliness of debt
repayment. Insurers or scoring agencies then calculate the insurance or credit score by taking the
information in the credit report and assigning positive weights to the favorable information and negative
weights to the unfavorable information.

What kind of information is not used in insurance scoring models?

Information such as an applicant’s income, ethnic group, age, gender, disability, religion, address, marital
status, and nationality are not considered when calculating an insurance score.

Why does Safeco use the insurance score of an applicant?

Safeco, as well as many other insurance companies, uses insurance scores because they provide an
objective way to evaluate the risk of an applicant. Independent studies and Safeco experience show that
insurance scores are a very good predictor of future losses. When insurance scores are combined with
traditional risk evaluation factors (such as prior claims history, years of driving experience and driving
record) insurance companies can more accurately determine the risk an applicant presents. By using
insurance scores combined with other factors, policies can be more accurately priced. Individuals who are
more likely to have a claim will pay more for insurance and individuals who are less likely to have a claim
will pay less.

What type of credit information is generally associated with a favorable insurance score?
* Lengthy, established credit history Absence of collections
° No late payments
* Low credit balances relative to limits available
* Few recently opened credit accounts (new accounts opened only as needed)
How can I learn more about my credit information and how to manage it?

A good credit rating must be built over time. There are no "quick fixes". The Federal Trade Commission
website provides articles about managing personal credit history and scores.

http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/credit/reports.shtm

How do | know what information is in my credit report?

Under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act you are entitled to receive a free copy of your credit report
once during any 12-month period. Otherwise, the credit bureau may charge a fee for more frequent
requests. It is a good idea for you to annually check your credit information on file with the three major

CN-7277/EP 2/21 Page 1 of 2
G1



=== Page 14 ===

*“* REPRINTED FROM THE ARCHIVE. THE ORIGINAL TRANSACTION MAY INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FORMS ****

credit bureaus to verify the report's accuracy. If an error is found, you should ask the credit bureau how to
correct the information.

How can I receive a copy of my credit report?

You can receive a copy of your credit report by contacting the following agencies.

* — www.annualcreditreport.com

¢ Equifax www.equifax.com 800-685-1111

° Experian www.experian.com 888-397-3742

* — Trans Union www.transunion.com 800-888-4213

I have an excellent credit rating; does this mean | qualify for the best insurance premium?

That depends. Since insurance scores measure items related to insurance losses and credit scores
measure creditworthiness, these scores may be very different. Items on a credit report considered by an
insurance company may not be ones considered by a lender. Likewise, there may be items on a credit
report used by a lender that are not relevant to an insurer. Additionally, insurance companies consider a
number of other factors when determining your automobile premium such as driving record, prior loss
history, and vehicle type. For your homeowner premium, insurers may consider prior loss history,
construction type, distance to fire stations and fire hydrants, and presence of protective devices such as
smoke detectors, theft alarms, and deadbolt locks. State laws and regulations also vary, so the factors
insurers may use to calculate premium or determine eligibility may differ by state.

Can an exception be made for customers who have experienced a medical hardship?

Yes, with the proper documentation, Safeco will take into consideration those customers that have gone
through a medical hardship and possess catastrophic medical expenses. Safeco may consider
exceptions for other extraordinary circumstances. Availability of these exceptions may vary due to
differences in state laws and regulations.

Does the use of credit by Safeco affect my credit rating?

There is no affect on an individual’s credit rating when Safeco makes an inquiry into their credit history.
No banks or other lending institutions will be able see the credit record inquiry made by Safeco. The only
record of the inquiry by Safeco will be on the copy obtained by the consumer, if he or she chooses to
receive a copy of their credit report.

What happens if Safeco makes an adverse decision based on my credit information?

Under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act an applicant is entitled to receive a free copy of their credit
report whenever an insurer or creditor has taken an adverse action’.

If Safeco takes an adverse decision based on your credit information, we will provide you with a separate
written notice advising you of the primary reasons for our action, the name, address and telephone
number of the consumer reporting agency that provided the information, and of your rights to receive a
free copy of your credit report.

If you notice an error on your credit report, you can dispute this information and ask the consumer
reporting agency to correct it. While an individual error is not likely to have a large impact on an insurance
score, if the error does impact your policy premium, Safeco will be glad to reevaluate the policy and
adjust the premium based on the corrected information.

*Your right to receive a free report due to an adverse action is in addition to the free credit report that you
are annually entitled to request from each nationwide credit bureau under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

Insurance Information and the Use of Credit

Thank you for being a Safeco Insurance customer. We appreciate your business and the trust you have
placed with us.

Like most insurance companies, we use credit information as a factor in determining the cost of your
insurance. We do so because research studies have shown it to be an accurate predictor of the proba-
bility of future insurance losses. Studies also show that a majority of customers benefit from the use of
credit information.

I's important to understand that many factors are used to determine the cost of insurance such as
driving history for auto insurance, the year your home was built for home insurance, previous insurance
and claims history, discounts and coverage limits. Your credit history is also part of the overall calcu-
lation that determines your premium. We look at credit history very differently than a financial institution
because we’re not evaluating your credit-worthiness. We’re using credit-based information in combina-
tion with other factors to help us properly price insurance risks.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

Why do you use my credit information?

Insurance companies often use credit information because it is a predictor of the probability of future
losses. Its use is an objective way to assess and price potential risk and enables us to more accurately
price policies and equitably distribute insurance costs among our policyholders.

Is my credit history the only factor that determines my rate?

No. Many factors such as previous insurance, claims history, discounts and coverage limits go into de-
termining what you pay for your insurance. In addition, the information you provided when you pur-
chased your policy and the verification of that information is used to determine your rate.

How do | know if I’m getting the best possible rate?

One of the benefits of buying insurance through an independent agent is their ability to advise you on
your options and ways to save money. Between the guidance of your local independent agent and a vast
array of Safeco options, you can be sure you’re getting the coverage you want at a competitive rate. If
you have any questions, we encourage you to contact your independent Safeco agent and ask for an
insurance checkup.

How is credit information used in determining my rate?

Safeco, like most insurance companies, calculates an insurance score based on information from your
credit report. Different values or weights are assigned to the information contained in your credit report,
such as payment history, amounts owed or the number of applications for new credit lines. The total sum
of these weights creates your insurance score. As a result, it is likely that some of your credit information
helped to improve your insurance score, and some lowered it. The calculation process and weights used
by each insurance company and/or its service providers are proprietary and confidential. As a result,
we do not disclose your specific score or the details of how it was calculated.

How did my credit information affect my rate?

Your rate was adversely affected because either we were unable to obtain an insurance score for you, or
because of your credit information. If it was due to your credit information, the reasons are explained

in this document under "What factors affected my insurance score?"

What can | do to improve my insurance score?

Safeco and independent insurance agents are not credit counselors or financial advisors, so we are not
in a position to provide specific advice on how to improve your credit or insurance score. However, we
can tell you that the areas that have the biggest impact on your credit report are: payment history,
amounts owed, length of credit history, new credit applications and type of credit accounts. To get a copy
of your current credit report, contact TransUnion and follow the instructions under “How do | get a copy
of my credit report?”

What factors affected my insurance score?
Below is more information about the factors that affected your insurance score and what you can do to
improve them:

CN-7278/EP 8/13

Average amount of time accounts have been established

What information is this message derived from? The score considers the average age of all of your
accounts. Recently opened accounts will lower the average age of your accounts.

How does this affect my insurance risk score? Research shows that consumers who have a long
established account history have fewer insurance losses.

What can | do to improve this aspect of my score? Open new accounts only when necessary. As
accounts age this component of your score will likely improve.

(Reason Code 322)
CN-7298/EP 7/12

Number of accounts ever past due

What information is this message derived from? The score considers the number of accounts that were
ever 30 days or more past due, reported in the last five (5) years.

How does this affect my insurance score? Research shows that consumers with missed payments have
more insurance losses.

What can | do to improve this aspect of my score? Avoid letting accounts get to a delinquent status.
Delinquencies remain on your credit report for seven years. Pay any accounts that are past due as soon
as possible.

(Reason Code 310)

*—* REPRINTED FROM THE ARCHIVE. THE ORIGINAL TRANSACTION MAY INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FORMS ****

Number of inquiries reported

What information is this message derived from? The score considers inquiries initiated by you when you
are actively seeking to obtain credit, or to obtain higher limits on an existing account. It does not consider
inquiries initiated by you to obtain your own insurance score or inquiries related to obtaining an insurance
policy. Promotional inquiries (such as an offer of an unsolicited credit card), account reviews by an
existing creditor, collection inquiries or other queries not solicited by you are not included in this score.
Inquiries as a result of searching for rates on a similar type of loan, such as auto and/or mortgage loans
are counted as one inquiry if they occur within 30 days.

How does this affect my insurance score? Research shows a correlation between applying for more credit
accounts, or extending your credit, with more insurance losses.

What can | do to improve this aspect of my score? Inquiries initiated by you will remain on your credit
report for two (2) years. A common misperception is that every inquiry drops your score a certain number
of points. In reality, the impact each inquiry has on your score varies depending on your overall credit
profile. To improve this aspect of your score, apply for credit only when needed.

(Reason Code 309)
CN-7287/EP 7/12




=== Page 20 ===

*—* REPRINTED FROM THE ARCHIVE. THE ORIGINAL TRANSACTION MAY INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FORMS ****

Number of open accounts reported as ‘paid as agreed’

What information is this message derived from? The score considers the number of open accounts on the
consumer's credit file that have been paid as agreed.

How does this affect my insurance risk score? Research shows that consumers with multiple active
accounts that are paid as agreed have fewer insurance losses.

What can | do to improve this aspect of my score? If you only have a few accounts, keeping them active
and making payments on time shows that you manage your credit obligations responsibly.
