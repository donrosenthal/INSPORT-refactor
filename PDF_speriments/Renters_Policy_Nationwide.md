loss. In this event, each party will choose a competent and impartial appraiser within 20

days after receiving a written request from the other. The two appraisers will choose an

umpire. If they cannot agree upon an umpire within 15 days, you or we may request that

the choice be made by a judge of a court of record in the state where the "residence

replacement cost, or cost to repair the property that is the subject of the claim. They are

conditions precedent, or any other contractual issues that may exist between you and us.

The appraisal award cannot be used by either you or us in any proceeding concerning

coverage, exclusions, forfeiture provisions, conditions precedent, or other contractual

issues. However, once contractual liability is admitted or determined, the appraisal award

1. "Nuclear Hazard” means any nuclear reaction, radiation, or radioactive contamination,
all whether controlled or uncontrolled or however caused, or any consequence of any
of these.
